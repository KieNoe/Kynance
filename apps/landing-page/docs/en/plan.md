# Overall Objectives

Establish a maintainable, rollback-capable, observable, and scalable frontend/full-stack engineering platform that ensures stable, high-performance delivery of complex visualization features across multiple terminals and network environments, while supporting controlled gradual deployment and rapid recovery.

## Compatibility

**Objective**
Ensure complete functionality and consistent performance on browsers/devices used by core users, with graceful degradation for lower-end devices.

**Specific Tasks**

- Establish browserslist + Babel + core-js strategy (e.g., `>0.5%, not dead, last 2 versions`) and include targets in CI builds
- Define support matrix (minimum versions of Safari/Chrome/Edge/Firefox / Android WebView / iOS WKWebView)
- Use Playwright for cross-browser E2E testing (desktop + iOS Safari WebKit simulation) and real device testing (BrowserStack or self-built device pool)
- CSS/layout: Adopt normalize.css + CSS Variables + fallbacks; avoid relying on APIs without widespread support (or use polyfills)
- Evaluate compatibility of critical third-party libraries (such as ECharts, WebGPU polyfills)

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Cover browser versions that represent the project's actual user distribution (e.g., covering ≥90% of traffic) with no serious errors in critical flows (login, chart rendering, order/save)
- CI blocks on low-compatibility changes (E2E failures prevent merging)

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ Test matrix too large → Prioritize coverage for highest-traffic browsers/devices; implement degraded experiences for low-traffic devices

## Performance Optimization (Rendering/Networking/Load)

**Objective**
Ensure first screen, interaction response, and chart rendering are within acceptable ranges (FCP/LCP/TTI, low interaction delay).

**Specific Tasks**

- Rendering layer: Implement "incremental redraw" algorithms, double buffering, object pools; move heavy calculations to WebWorker + comlink
- Computation layer: Migrate complex indicators to WASM (TA-Lib port), or use Cloudflare Workers for aggregation/downsampling, with client handling only visualization
- Data layer: Implement client-side throttling/downsampling; implement delta-update data protocol (sending only diffs)
- Build/release: vite-plugin-incremental-build, vite.config optimization (tree shaking, on-demand loading, responsive syntax sugar compilation as needed)
- Performance monitoring & testing: Add `benchmarks/` in repo, use k6/artillery for stress testing; integrate Lighthouse in CI (key metrics thresholds for pass/fail)
- Weak network degradation: Caching strategies (Service Worker), offline compensation, UI degradation (simplified charts)

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Sample metrics: First screen rendering measurable and stable; 95th percentile interaction response < 100ms (verifiable with RUM); memory peak within target range; critical chart rendering framerate meets interaction requirements
- Benchmark tests have repeatable scripts and don't regress performance scores in PRs

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ WASM/Worker integration complexity → First implement feasibility with Worker + JS, then migrate to WASM

## Telemetry & Observability

**Objective**
Build a telemetry/monitoring system that can both perform business analysis and troubleshoot failures (frontend events + RUM + APM + metrics/alerts).

**Specific Tasks**

- Event design: Define unified event schema (`event_category, event_action, event_label, user_id_anonymized, timestamp, ctx`), and write to event dictionary (owners, sampling rates, importance)
- Data pipeline: Frontend sending → Backend entry point (batch/compression capable) → Message system (Kafka or custom queue) → OLAP / BI
- Real-time monitoring: Integrate RUM (web-vitals + Sentry/Datadog/Elastic APM), backend using Prometheus + Grafana (or cloud vendor equivalent)
- Anomaly detection: Custom exception clustering, outlier detection (automatic alerts triggering gradual rollback)
- Privacy compliance: Prohibit reporting sensitive PII, use hash/anonymization strategies

**Acceptance Criteria**

- All key user actions have unique and consistent tracking; tracking documentation coverage 100%; when exceptions occur, responsible service/version/user cohort can be identified in a single alert

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ Tracking chaos leading to maintenance difficulties → Establish tracking approval process and event lifecycle management (deletion/deprecation mechanism)

## Security & Compliance

**Objective**
Ensure the application meets financial-grade security standards, prevents data leaks and malicious attacks, while complying with relevant regulations.

**Specific Tasks**

- Frontend security: Implement CSP (Content Security Policy), SRI (Subresource Integrity), CSRF protection; disable dangerous APIs (like eval)
- Data security: Encrypt sensitive data storage (localStorage/IndexedDB); full TLS 1.3 for transport layer; implement secure JWT handling
- Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA); protection against brute force attacks (rate limiting); session management (auto-logout, device binding)
- Dependency security: Use npm audit / Snyk scanning; regularly update dependencies; establish vulnerability response process
- Compliance checks: GDPR/CCPA data processing compliance; financial industry-specific compliance requirements (if applicable)

**Acceptance Criteria**

- All OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities fixed; pass third-party security audit; complete audit logs for sensitive operations
- All user data processing complies with privacy regulations; users can export/delete their own data

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ Security measures impact user experience → Tiered security strategy, strong security for core functionality, balanced experience for non-core functionality

## Scalable Architecture

**Objective**
Build a modular, scalable frontend architecture that supports rapid feature iteration and team collaboration.

**Specific Tasks**

- Code organization: Implement monorepo-based modular architecture (lerna/nx/turborepo); clearly define module boundaries and dependencies
- State management: Use Pinia/Redux Toolkit for centralized state management; implement predictable unidirectional data flow
- Component design: Establish component library and design system; implement Atomic Design methodology
- API layer: Unified API client (automatic retry, caching, error handling); implement GraphQL or REST adapter layer
- Extension mechanism: Plugin system design; support for dynamic module loading; provide stable internal APIs

**Acceptance Criteria**

- New features can be extended via plugins/modules without modifying core code
- High component reuse rate (≥70%); low code duplication rate (≤5%)
- Clear module dependencies, zero circular dependencies

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ Over-design leading to decreased development efficiency → Progressive architecture, first meet current needs, reserve extension points but avoid over-abstraction

## Internationalization & Localization (i18n & l10n)

**Objective**
Support multi-language, multi-region, and multi-cultural user interfaces and content, providing a consistent global experience.

**Specific Tasks**

- Text internationalization: Use vue-i18n/react-intl for text translation; support plural forms and contextual translations
- Numbers/dates/currencies: Display different formats based on region (Intl API); support different time zones and calendar systems
- Layout adaptation: Support RTL (right-to-left) languages; handle text length variations in different languages
- Translation workflow: Establish translation management system; support incremental translation and automatic detection of missing translations
- Cultural adaptation: Adjust colors, icons, sample data, and other culturally sensitive elements based on region

**Acceptance Criteria**

- UI displays correctly in all supported languages without layout breakage
- 100% translation coverage; new text has extraction and management process
- Number, date, and currency formats conform to regional conventions

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ High translation quality and maintenance costs → Use professional translation services; establish automated translation processes and quality checks

## Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

**Objective**
Establish highly automated development, testing, and deployment processes that support rapid iteration and secure releases.

**Specific Tasks**

- CI process: Use GitHub Actions/Jenkins to implement automated testing (unit tests, E2E, visual regression)
- CD strategy: Implement blue-green deployment/canary releases; support one-click rollback; automated environment configuration
- Environment management: Isolate development, testing, staging, and production environments; manage environment-specific configurations
- Build optimization: Cache dependencies and build artifacts; parallel builds; incremental builds
- Quality gates: Code quality checks (ESLint/Stylelint); test coverage requirements; performance benchmark tests

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Fully automated process from code submission to production deployment, without manual intervention
- Short deployment time (≤10 minutes); even shorter rollback time (≤2 minutes)
- Complete changelog and deployment record for each release

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ Complex CI/CD processes leading to maintenance difficulties → Modular CI/CD configuration; provide self-service tools

## User Experience Optimization (UX)

**Objective**

- Micro-interactions: Add appropriate animations and transition effects; provide visual guidance and hints

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Improved user satisfaction scores (measured through questionnaires)
- Reduced time to complete key tasks; lower error rates
- Pass accessibility audits; support for assistive technologies

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ Disconnect between design and development → Adopt design systems and component libraries; close collaboration between designers and developers

## Data Visualization Enhancement

**Objective**
Provide high-performance, interactive, information-rich data visualization components that support complex financial data analysis.

**Specific Tasks**

- Chart library: Build financial-specific chart library based on ECharts/D3.js; support custom indicators and analysis tools

- Professional, clear visual presentation; distinct information hierarchy
- Users can complete all key analysis tasks without switching tools

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ Complex visualizations impact performance → Implement progressive rendering; load data on demand; optimize rendering algorithms

## Offline & Poor Network Support

**Objective**
Maintain basic application functionality in unstable network or offline environments, providing seamless user experience.

**Specific Tasks**

- Offline storage: Use IndexedDB/localStorage to store key data; implement local database synchronization mechanisms
- Network detection: Monitor network status changes; provide automatic reconnection and data synchronization after network recovery
- Resource caching: Use Service Worker to cache static resources and API responses; implement caching strategies (stale-while-revalidate)
- Queue mechanism: Queue offline operations; automatically submit when network recovers; conflict resolution strategies
- Degraded experience: Define feature degradation strategies; provide alternative UI and functionality in offline mode

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Application accessible with core functionality in completely offline state; no data loss
- Acceptable response times in poor network environments; clear loading status feedback
- Automatic data synchronization when network recovers, without user intervention

**Risks & Mitigation**
▸ Data synchronization conflicts → Implement optimistic updates and conflict resolution strategies; preserve operation history

- Data pipeline: Frontend sending → Backend entry point (batch/compression capable) → Message system (Kafka or custom queue) → OLAP / BI.

- Real-time monitoring: Integrate RUM (web-vitals + Sentry/Datadog/Elastic APM), backend using Prometheus + Grafana (or cloud vendor equivalent).

- Anomaly detection: Custom exception clustering, outlier detection (automatic alerts triggering gradual rollback).

- Privacy compliance: Prohibit reporting sensitive PII, use hash/anonymization strategies.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- All key user actions have unique and consistent tracking; tracking documentation coverage 100%; when exceptions occur, responsible service/version/user cohort can be identified in a single alert.

**Risks & Mitigation**

- Risk: Tracking chaos leading to maintenance difficulties -> Establish tracking approval process and event lifecycle management (deletion/deprecation mechanism).

## Security

**Objective**
Protect against common frontend and backend attacks, ensure dependency chain and operational credential security.

**Specific Tasks**

- Frontend security: Site-wide CSP, SRI, strict input/output escaping, avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, Content-Type & X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, SameSite Cookies.

- Backend/API: CSRF protection, authentication (OAuth2/OIDC), secure session/token strategies, rate limiting and WAF.

- Dependency security: Automated dependency scanning (Dependabot/Snyk), block high-risk vulnerabilities during build.

- Secret management: Use Vault / KMS for key management, CI secrets not stored in plaintext.

- Penetration/audit: Regular SAST/DAST, third-party penetration testing, while maintaining audit logs and change records.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Automated scanning shows no high-risk vulnerabilities; critical HTTP security headers covered; pass one external penetration test (or fix known issues).

- Risks & Mitigation

- Risk: Third-party dependency vulnerabilities -> Block high-risk dependencies and replace or isolate early.

## Canary Deployment / Feature Flags

**Objective**: Minimize risk through feature flags + canary/deploy strategies, and support observable gradual rollback.

- Specific Tasks

  - Selection: External services (LaunchDarkly, etc.) or open source (Unleash/Flagsmith), and include flags as part of the configuration center.

  - CI/CD integration: Build artifact → Deploy Canary pool (by userId/hash or header) → Monitor key metrics → Automatic scaling/rollback.

  - Rollback: Implement "one-click flag disable / version rollback" runbook and display currently active flags on dashboard.

- Acceptance Criteria

  - Ability to first push new features to a small range of users (e.g., internal/test groups), and "turn off" on the dashboard and trigger automatic rollback when errors occur.

- Risks & Mitigation

  - Risk: State inconsistency (cache or CDN) causing gradual deployment failure -> Flags need to be written on both client/server and support immediate effect strategies.

## Regular Backup & Disaster Recovery

**Objective**: Ensure data recoverability (backup) and system availability or quick recovery during regional failures.

- Specific Tasks

  - DB: Automatic snapshots + incremental backups + cross-region replication (at least 2 off-site backups).

  - Files/assets: Object storage versioning + cold backup to another provider.

  - Backup strategy & retention policy: Clear retention periods, encryption, access control.

  - Recovery drills: Regular recovery drills and production of recovery documentation (restore runbook).

- Acceptance Criteria

  - Ability to recover consistent data from backups (verified by recovery drills); backup files can be decrypted and are complete.

- Risks & Mitigation

  - Risk: Unverified backups -> Enforce periodic recovery drills and record RTO/RPO metrics (specify targets in documentation).

## Permission Management (Authz/Authn)

**Objective**: Implement principle of least privilege, with traceable permission audits.

- Specific Tasks

  - Authentication: Use OIDC / SSO (supporting SAML / OAuth2), centralized identity provider.

  - Authorization: RBAC (roles mapped to resources/operations), consider ABAC (attribute-based) for fine-grained scenarios.

  - Frontend: Hide UI elements at route/view layer, but enforce all authorization on backend; implement permission matrix + management UI.

  - Audit: Record sensitive operation logs (who/what/when) for post-event auditing.

- Acceptance Criteria

  - All sensitive operations have backend verification and audit logs; permission changes have approval and rollback paths.

- Risks & Mitigation

  - Risk: Complex permission rules -> Start with minimal set, gradually refine, prioritize strict control of high-risk functionality.

## Content Platform Development (CMS / Content Platform)

**Objective**: Provide a manageable content platform for promotional pages, help centers, product announcements, articles/strategies, etc., supporting static generation/preview/permissions.

- Specific Tasks

  - Selection: If lightweight and developer-friendly, recommend Git-backed SSG (VitePress + Git workflow); if many non-technical users, choose Headless CMS (Strapi / Sanity / Netlify CMS).

  - Features: Version control, preview, scheduled publishing, rich text + markdown mixed layout, image/asset management, roles/workflow (editor->review->publish).

  - Search & CDN: Integrate MeiliSearch / Elastic + CDN (cache static content).

  - i18n: Built-in multi-language support for content (translation workflow).

- Acceptance Criteria

  - Non-technical users can publish content through CMS and preview; publishing can trigger SSG rebuild and take effect on CDN.

- Risks & Mitigation

  - Risk: CMS cost/complexity -> Initially use Git+SSG for minimum viability, later migrate based on business needs.

## Cross-cutting & Engineering Governance

- SemVer + Changesets for packages (already listed): Enforce changelogs and automated releases.

- Monorepo dependency constraints (core → services → presentation), dependency inversion + interface contracts.

- CI/CD: PR lint → unit tests → e2e (Playwright) → perf check (Lighthouse) → automated Canary deployment.

- Baseline directories: `benchmarks/`, `observability/`, `runbooks/`, `infra/terraform/`.

- Testing: Unit test coverage targets (e.g., 80% for critical logic), E2E covering important paths.

- Documentation: Each feature/flag/tracking point must have an owner and documentation for easier operations.

## Acceptance & Monitoring Metrics Examples (Suggested for Display on Monitoring Dashboard)

- Performance: FCP / LCP / TTFB / TTI / CLS; 95p interaction delay < 100ms (definable), chart rendering framerate > 30fps (during interaction).

- Stability: Error rate (5xx/Client JS error rate), APDEX / user availability rate, error increase rate within 30 minutes after deployment.

- Business: Success rates for critical paths (e.g., chart loading success rate, backtesting task submission success rate).

- Backup/recovery: Results of most recent recovery drill (success/failure + issue list).

## Implementation Priority

- Phase 0 (Infrastructure + Standards): CI/CD + SemVer/changesets, browserslist, event schema, basic CSP, dependency scanning.

- Phase 1 (Observation & Gradual Deployment): Tracking + RUM + APM integration, feature-flag introduction & Canary process, benchmarks/ baseline cases.

- Phase 2 (Performance & Isolation): WebWorker + comlink, Cloudflare Workers aggregation, WASM PoC, virtual scrolling, object pools.

- Phase 3 (Hardening): Regular backups+recovery drills, penetration testing, permission management UI, content platform launch.

## Example Snippets

- browserslist (example)

```text
>0.5%
not dead
last 2 versions
iOS >= 13
Android >= 8
```

- Brief CSP (example, adjust according to actual resources)

```text
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'nonce-<RANDOM>' https://cdn.example.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https://images.example.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://api.example.com https://analytics.example.com;
  frame-ancestors 'none';
```

- Event tracking example (JSON schema)

```json
{
  "event_name": "chart_switch",
  "category": "ui_interaction",
  "action": "switch_indicator",
  "label": "MACD",
  "user_hash": "xxxx",
  "ts": 1690000000,
  "ctx": { "page": "market/stocks/xxx", "chart_id": "kline_main" }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls (Lessons learned)

- Don't scale gradual deployment before monitoring is in place: You might not see problems before expanding the impact.

- Tracking without governance becomes a "data junkyard"—event aging, naming conflicts, sampling policies must be managed.

- Premature performance optimization causes complexity inflation—use measurable benchmarks to drive optimization.

## Next Steps

1. GitHub Issues (broken down by Phase, including Acceptance Criteria)

2. CSV / Excel task list (easy to import into PM tools)

3. OKR / Milestone list (for Roadmap board)

4. Detailed runbook templates (backup/rollback/incident response)
